# Transdiagnostic Profiles of BOLD Signal Variability in Autism and Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders: Associations with Cognition and Functioning

## Project Overview

This repository contains code and data used in the analyses for the manuscript titled **"Transdiagnostic Profiles of BOLD Signal Variability in Autism and Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders: Associations with Cognition and Functioning."** It contains  scripts used to compute and analyze BOLD signal variability, measured as mean squared successive difference (MSSD), across participants with autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia spectrum disorder, and typically developing controls.

### Folder Structure

- **MSSD Calculation** – Code for computing Mean Squared Successive Difference from fMRI timeseries
- **Regional MSSD Analysis** – Statistical analyses at the individual region level
- **Network MSSD Analysis** – Group comparisons and associations at the network level
